Screening Boosted Trees (sbt) — M1 release.

A GBDT framework where each candidate split is scored by an *absolute*
relevance value derived from the screening transform in "Screening Is Enough"
(Nakanishi 2026, arXiv:2604.01178). Splits below a learnable threshold are
rejected exactly, enabling the tree to represent "no relevant split" without
an external min_gain_to_split heuristic.

NumPy reference (always available):

    from sbt import ScreeningParams, ScreeningTree
    from sbt import screening_split_numpy, build_histogram_numpy

Triton-accelerated path (requires [triton] extra):

    from sbt import screening_split_triton, build_histogram_triton
